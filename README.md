# Pour_Decisions
This project is to develop a software that can scan wine bottle barcodes and return the score as rated on Vivino.

---------------------
**Initial Project Description and Process**

My hope for this project will be to create an app that, after accessing the camera on my phone, is able to scan any barcode on a bottle or carton of wine and return both the Vivino and Spoonacular scores to the device to help the user determine what bottle they wish to consume. Given my personal device is an Android, my current plans are to develop this for an android system, and therefore will use primarily the app's frontend development. The reason for this decision was the extent to Java's seemingly wider support and, given I am doing this project as a development and learning exercise, Java appears to be a more beneficial language for me to learn.

I currently plan to use Python for the backend development of this project, as I see this as a great opportunity to develop my skills in this area further. Initial research also suggests that OpenCV (Python) is particularly well suited for image processing, which works well for my barcode scanning approach. I may also integratethird party SDKs such as Scandit for the barcode scanning if required.

I also intend to use SQL to navigate the database interactions on the backend.
